            <h2>Main Characteristics of a PWA</h2>
            <p>A Progressive Web Application (PWA) is a type of web application that delivers a native app-like experience to users while being built and delivered using web technologies.</p>
            <p>Key characteristics of PWAs include:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Progressive Enhancement: PWAs are designed to work on any device and provide a consistent user experience across different platforms and screen sizes.</li>
                <li>Responsive Design: PWAs adapt to various screen sizes and orientations, ensuring optimal viewing and interaction experiences on both desktop and mobile devices.</li>
                <li>Connectivity Independence: PWAs can work offline or with limited connectivity by caching content and using service workers to handle network requests.</li>
                <li>App-like Experience: PWAs offer features like push notifications, installation prompts, and home screen icons, blurring the line between web and native apps.</li>
                <li>Secure: PWAs are served over HTTPS to ensure data security and integrity, protecting users' information from unauthorized access or tampering.</li>
            </ul>
