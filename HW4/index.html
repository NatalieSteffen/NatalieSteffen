            <h2>Main Characteristics of a PWA</h2>
            <p>A Progressive Web Application (PWA) is a type of web application that delivers an app-like experience while being made with web technologies.</p>
            <p>Some key characteristics of PWAs:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>PPWAs are designed to work on any device and provide a consistent user experience across different devices and screen sizes.</li>
                <li>PWAs can work offline or with limited connectivity by caching content and using service workers to handle network requests.</li>
                <li>PWAs can offer a more app-like experince by offering things like push notifications, installation prompts, or home screen icons, blurring the line between web and native apps.</li>
                <li>PWAs are served over HTTPS to ensure data security and integrity, protecting users' information from unauthorized access or tampering.</li>
            </ul>
